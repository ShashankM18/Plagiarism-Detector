# 🔍 Plagiarism Detector Web App
 
This is a simple yet effective Plagiarism Detection Web Application built with Python (Flask) and HTML/CSS (Bootstrap). The app allows users to upload multiple code files and evaluates the pairwise similarity using AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) and text-based difflib comparison.

In addition to a CSV report, the app also generates a graphical output — a horizontal bar chart that visually represents the similarity scores between every unique file pair. This helps in quickly identifying highly similar code files through a clear, comparative visual.

#### 📊 Graphical Output
After comparing the uploaded files, the application automatically generates a horizontal bar chart representing the similarity scores for each file pair. This visual makes it easy to:
- Instantly spot pairs with high similarity
- Understand code reuse or potential plagiarism at a glance
- Present findings in a clear and visual format
